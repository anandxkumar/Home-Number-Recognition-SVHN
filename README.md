# Home-Number-Recognition-SVHN
A deep learning project to recognize home numbers in an image.

Problem:
Given an image, the task is to identify the number in the image. The number to be identified is a sequence of digits, s = s1; s2; : : : ; sn. When determining the accuracy of a digit transcriber, we compute the proportion of the input images for which the length n of the sequence and every element si of the sequence is predicted correctly.
